Welcome to the Experiment Notebook (`enb`) user manual.

The `enb` library can help you design, run and plot experiments in no times.

It is ideal for cases where:

	- multiple inputs need to be processed by one or more customizable tasks, producing a table of data
	- one wants to apply custom code to existing data to produce new columns
	- analysis tables and plots are needed for one or more data columns
