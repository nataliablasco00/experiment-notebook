Welcome to the Experiment Notebook
===============================================

The Experiment Notebook (from now on, ``enb``) library is designed to help you obtain
and report computer-based experimental data. Focus on what is new in your
current experiment, and let ``enb`` deal with the repetitive stuff.

Some of the main features of ``enb`` are:

  * **Flexible**: you can easily adapt the provided examples to suit your needs.
  * **Persistent**: no need to re-run your experiments: results are automatically saved.
  * **Disseminable**: ``enb`` helps you create figures and tables to report your data.
  * **Extensible**: you can always add new samples, define new columns and produce new figures.

.. note::
   ``enb`` is based on well-known python libraries such as ``pandas`` and ``pyplot``.
   No prior knowledge of these libraries is required, although it is highly recommended.

The following help pages will tour you through the most important features of ``enb``,
and show minimal examples that you can use as starting point for your projects.
You can also take a look at the automatically generated :ref:`API<api>`.
