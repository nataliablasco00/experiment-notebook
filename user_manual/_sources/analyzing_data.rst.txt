Analyzing data
==============

The :mod:`enb.aanalysis` module is the second half of the `enb` library.
It is devoted to help you produce high-quality figures
for easy result analysis, and to include in reports and other documents.

It is designed so that:

    * The output of your experiments can be easily and quickly analyzed
    * You can analyze external data (.csv is used as universal interchange format)

The basics of using analyzers is in the next section.
A gallery of examples very loosely categorized is provided in the next one.
